        <h1>Create and run a job</h1>
        <p>
          Unity jobs let you schedule small units of work so the main thread can keep rendering and gameplay responsive.
          A job typically operates on NativeArray data, is scheduled from the main thread, and completed when the results
          are needed. This fixture intentionally contains enough text to exercise markdown conversion and extraction logic.
        </p>
        <h2>Schedule and Complete best practices</h2>
        <p>
          Use JobHandle dependencies to chain work, avoid forcing the main thread to wait too early, and call Complete as
          late as possible when you need job results. This helps maximize parallel throughput and keeps frame time stable.
        </p>
        <p>
          For data-parallel workloads, use IJobParallelFor with a tuned batch count and avoid oversynchronizing unrelated
          jobs. Profiling helps determine whether you should split long jobs into smaller dependent jobs.
