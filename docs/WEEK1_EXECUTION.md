# Week 1 Execution

This tracker is for Week 1 only: improve onboarding and conversion from first visit to first successful query.

## Week 1 Objective

Reduce friction so a new user can go from landing on the repo to a working cited answer quickly and predictably.

## Deliverables

1. README optimized for conversion:
- clear value proposition
- quick start with copy-paste commands
- verification and troubleshooting path

2. Contributor onboarding tightened:
- clear first-contribution workflow
- explicit contribution quality expectations

3. Metrics baseline captured:
- current stars
- weekly clone trend
- weekly unique visitor trend

## Day-by-Day Plan

## Day 1

- Finalize onboarding messaging in README.
- Verify command examples against current CLI.

Definition of done:
- README quick start is complete and internally consistent.

## Day 2

- Tighten contribution path and expectations.
- Ensure docs reference correct internal notes path.

Definition of done:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` supports first-time contributors without guesswork.

## Day 3

- Create 3 demo prompts with expected retrieval behavior.
- Validate each prompt against local setup.

Definition of done:
- Prompts are reproducible and ready for social/community sharing.

## Day 4

- Prepare launch artifacts:
- one short post draft
- one short demo capture plan

Definition of done:
- One publish-ready post draft exists with repo link and setup CTA.

## Day 5

- Review week metrics and blockers.
- Finalize next-week backlog from observed friction points.

Definition of done:
- Week 1 retrospective added with concrete next actions.

## Risks

- Large artifact generation time can reduce first-session success.

## Mitigation

- Keep `unitydocs doctor` prominent in onboarding.
- Keep setup instructions explicit and copy-paste ready.
